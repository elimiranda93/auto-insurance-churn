# Auto Insurance Retention Capstone
</div>

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that will identify the likelihood of customer retention based on aspects of their demographic. Identifying aspects of customer demographics associated with increased retention will help to guide an insurance carriers marketing efforts by provide them with insights into what markets they can cut ad spending. This cut in ad spending could be forwarded to customers in other markets in the form of premium reduction.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### ➡️ Data Cleaning
Data cleaning consists of removing irrelevant features, handling null/missing data, converting features into appropriate dtypes and checking for duplicate data. 

### 🕵️‍♂️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helped understand feature distributions and relationships with loan status, thus informing model choice and guiding feature engineering.


## Coming Soon
### 🧠 Feature Engineering

### 🏭 Modeling
The testing and evaluation of models, including:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

## 📝 Findings and Conclusions
